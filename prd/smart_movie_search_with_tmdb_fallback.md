Feature: Smart Movie Search with TMDB Fallback
1. Overview

This feature allows users to search for movies inside the application. The system first checks the local database (Supabase) for existing entries. If the movie is not found, it queries The Movie Database (TMDB) API, displays the results, and prompts the user to add the movie to the local collection.

2. Goals & Benefits

Improve user experience by providing instant autocomplete from local DB.

Reduce duplication: always check local DB first.

Expand collection by leveraging TMDB’s large movie catalog.

Keep local DB up to date as users add missing movies.

3. User Stories

As a user, I want to type a movie title and see autocomplete suggestions from the local database.

As a user, if the movie is not found locally, I want the app to fetch results from TMDB.

As a user, I want the option to add a TMDB result into the local database with one click.

As a user, once I’ve added a movie, I want it to appear in future searches from my local DB.

4. Functional Requirements
4.1 Search Input

A search bar with autocomplete.

Queries local DB (Supabase) first.

Supports partial matches (case-insensitive).

4.2 Local Database Lookup

Query movies table in Supabase.

Return results sorted by relevance.

4.3 TMDB API Integration

If no local results, call TMDB Search API:
GET /search/movie?query=<movie title>

Display top 5 results (title, year, poster, overview).

4.4 Add to Database

Show an “Add this movie” button next to each TMDB result.

On click, insert the movie into Supabase movies table with fields:

id (UUID, Supabase primary key)

tmdb_id (integer, from TMDB)

title (string)

release_date (date)

poster_url (string)

overview (text)

created_at (timestamp)

4.5 Confirmation

After adding, show toast notification:
✅ “<Movie Title> has been added to your library.”

5. Non-Functional Requirements

Search latency < 300ms (local).

TMDB fallback must show results within ~2s.

Handle API rate limits (TMDB free tier = 40 requests every 10s).

Secure TMDB API key via Next.js server-side API routes.

6. UI/UX Requirements

Autocomplete dropdown with two sections:

Local Results (if any).

TMDB Results (with “Add” button).

Poster thumbnails displayed for recognition.

Keyboard support:

Arrow keys to navigate suggestions.

Enter to select/add movie.

7. Technical Implementation
Frontend (Next.js)

React component: <MovieSearch />

Uses /api/search?query=... endpoint.

Renders autocomplete with results.

Backend (Next.js API Route)

/api/search:

Query Supabase movies.

If results exist → return them.

Else call TMDB API → return results.

/api/add-movie:

Accepts TMDB movie object.

Inserts into Supabase movies.

Database (Supabase)

movies table:

Column	Type	Notes
id	uuid (pk)	auto-generated
tmdb_id	int	unique constraint
title	text	required
release_date	date	nullable
poster_url	text	optional
overview	text	optional
created_at	timestamp	default now()

8. Future Enhancements (Not in Scope Now)

Add TV shows as well as movies.

Store genres, cast, crew from TMDB.

Support bulk importing.

Caching TMDB results in Redis for performance.
